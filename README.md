TruckStaffer Interview Portal Requirements & Workflow
1. Account Creation & Security
• When a candidate creates a profile, they immediately receive a verification email to confirm their email address.
• Password input should have a “show/hide password” toggle for convenience while typing.
• All accounts should be tied to a verified email for security and easy communication.
2. Branding & Design
• The portal should be fully integrated under the TruckStaffer.com domain.
• Use TruckStaffer’s official colors, fonts, and template styles for a consistent aesthetic and professional flow.
• The look/feel of the landing page, questionnaire, and portal must feel like one seamless system.
3. Candidate Questionnaire & Document Upload
• Mixed response options for simplicity:
  ✅ Multiple-choice & drop-down menus for standard questions
  ✅ “Other” option with a free-text field for extra details
• Swift document uploads for required credentials (CDL, Med Card, W9, Insurance, etc.)
• Progressive prompts – after answering one section, it smoothly transitions to the next
• If not completed in one sitting, candidate can save progress and return later.
4. Application Stages & Next Steps
• After answering all required questions & uploading docs, candidates should be prompted to the next logical step based on their stage:
  ✅ If docs are missing → send reminder email + keep status “Pending”
  ✅ If everything is complete → prompt to schedule interview
  ✅ If approved → confirmation email with next onboarding steps
5. Scheduling Interviews
• Integration with a Calendly-style calendar showing available dates & times for interviews.
• Once the interview is scheduled:
  ✅ Candidate gets email confirmation
  ✅ Portal updates candidate’s status to Interview Scheduled
  ✅ Candidate receives reminders 24 hrs before interview
6. Notifications & Status Updates
• Automated email + system notifications at each stage:
  ✅ Profile created → “Please verify your email”
  ✅ Docs missing → “Reminder: Complete your application”
  ✅ Interview scheduled → “Your interview is set for [date/time]”
  ✅ Status pending → periodic reminders to finish process
  ✅ Status approved/rejected → notification with next steps
7. Admin Dashboard
• Universal admin view of all candidates with filters for:
  ✅ In Progress
  ✅ Pending (missing info/docs)
  ✅ Completed/Ready for interview
  ✅ Scheduled interviews
  ✅ Approved/Rejected
• Ability to export filtered data & run reports (e.g., all CDL-A vs CDL-B, insurance verified vs missing, etc.)
• Ability to tag candidates (e.g., “Ready to Deploy,” “Needs Follow-Up,” “Rejected”)
8. Reporting & Data Management
• Backend should allow filtered reports by:
  ✅ Credential status (who has insurance, CDL, etc.)
  ✅ Application stage (pending, completed, approved)
  ✅ Equipment type (Tri-Axle, Quad-Axle, etc.)
• Admin can download/export data in CSV/Excel for record-keeping or payroll purposes.
